            <p>There are many definitions of what software is. For example, this flourish definition by Ada Lovelace, the mother of all computing. </p>
            <p>A software engineer defines and designs the flow of the software they create. A classical program flow, usually described with UML diagrams, basically describes how based on some input data, you get some output data. And the software is what implements that flow.</p>
            <p>On more complex situations, what we want to do is make some componentes interact with each other. But this interaction, in the end, is nothing more than exchanges of data bits.</p>

            <p>Complex software architectures are made of several components you have to interconnect, like a database, a user interface, an analysis tool,... The pieces of software that connects them are the middleware, the "glue", the orchestration between those components. These interactions between different unit operations are what make your usecase work.</p>
            <p>Usually you design a flow that defines how each component interact with the rest. This flow can be linear or circular, split into several threads, have conditional steps,... and that's what you have to implement to make your software adapts to your usecase.</p>
            <p>Integration Frameworks, can help us orchestrate and automate the interaction between different applications, APIs, third party services or any other software piece we may have to connect.</p>
            <p>A proper integration tool should provide us with the following features: transformation, integration patterns and connectors to existing protocols and components.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Let's start with transformations. When we connect different components of an architecture, they rarely speak the same languages or, on this case, data formats. Some components will output an xml that has to be fed to the following component on a json form. Maybe we even need to add or remove some attributes on that json data. An integration framework allows us to define what is the mapping between the output of one component and the input of the following so we can forget about the explicit implementation. The less code we have to maintain, the better.</p>
            <p>Now, being able to transform data on each step is not enough if we can‚Äôt connect to (and from) the specific component we need. Our ideal integration framework should offer support for common protocols like ftp, http, jdbc,‚Ä¶ Also it should offer support to connect to common components like a mail server, messaging services, atom,‚Ä¶ We could claim even that no integration tool would be good if it doesn‚Äôt also support specific well known services like being able to send a message through a Telegram bot or store information on Elastic Search. Being able to seamlessly connect from one component to the next without having to worry about the specifics of their interfaces is what distinguishes an average integration tool from a good integration tool.</p>
            <p>And finally, not all flows will be lineal (->). Some of the steps will require broadcasting, some of them will require conditional flowing. Some will require waiting the output of different components to conflate the data. These action patterns are something that have been studied for a long time. And as with software development patterns, you can classify them and study them to create better integrations. You can find them as "Enterprise Integration Patterns".</p>

            <h3>Adopt a cat</h3>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>For example: imagine we have to implement the software an animal shelter is going to use to run cat adoptions. We would have two kind of inputs: one being new cats waiting to be adopted and another being people coming to the shelter to adopt a cat.</p>
            <p>The abstract flow for this software is pretty easy to understand: when a new cat enters, you register it as waiting for adoption. When a new person enters, you check if there is any cat available, and decide what to do: either adopt a cat or, if no cat is available, you tell that person they will have to try again at a later time.</p>
            <p>Once you have the requirements clear, you move on to define the software architecture.</p>

            <p>On this case, we decided that we need a database to store the data of the cats waiting to be registered. We also decided that the input data is going to be in JSON format and that we will receive the inputs via kafka brokers.</p>
            <p>Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications. Or put it simply: Kafka is a very light messaging service that allows clients to receive messages.</p>
            <p>This means that we have two different components, the database and Kafka brokers, that we want to connect with some logic. We could do it by implementing all the workflow from scratch, adding connector libraries as dependencies and handling secrets and listeners. </p>
            <p>On this talk I am going to show how to use one of those Integration Frameworks to connect different pieces of your software architecture with minimal effort.</p>

            <p>The framework we are going to use is Apache Camel. Camel is not only one of the most active projects inside the Apache Software Foundation, it is also the lightest and most complete integration framework available. And on top of it, it is also Free and Open Source Software! Which is always a warrantee of quality and good practices.</p>
            <p>Camel is already an old actor on the integration world. It has support for hundreds of components, protocols and formats. Some of these protocols come very handy allowing the user, for example, to connect to any REST API that they need.</p>
            <p>Camel uses its own DSL, a simplified language to define easily the workflows step by step.</p>
            <p>Camel is available in Knative with the name CamelK. And Camel is also available over Quarkus, the supersonic subatomic Java.</p>

            <p>If we want to take a look at how Camel works on the inside, it has different pieces to connect to each type of component. These connectors can be connector that read something on an external components, which we will call consumers; or they can write something on an external component, which we will call producers. Between a reading from a component and a writing to another component we have the router.</p>
            <p>The router is the piece of software that carries most of the logic and decides what is going to be the following step.</p>
            <p>The data that flows from the consumer to the producer is encapsulated on a type of message called exchange. </p>

            <p>We can link this pieces together forming a chain of commands that defines the flow. This way the exchange will move from one component to the following.</p>
            <p>The join of the consumer and the producer for the same component is what we call an endpoint. </p>

            <p>Remember that any good integration framework allows you to have conditional statments, parallel processing, and similar integration patterns. On our cat adoption case, we will have a conditional on the flow that will decide if a person adopts a cat or not.</p>
            <p>Given a list of elements, we could also tell Apache Camel to iterate on each of those elements and run a separated thread of flow for each of them. We could also merge again all those threads of flow into one single thread of flow.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The exchange that carries the data has many elements. Obviously it carries the data itself, which we call the body of the message. But similarly as how the HTTP protocol works, you can add headers to that message that can give context to your flow. For example, you can store credentials on those headers or any other value that can be used on a later step but is not included explicitly on the data being carried forward.</p>
            <p>If there's any error that throws an exception during the routing or the processing of the message, it will also be stored on the exchange, making it easier to recover from errors. For example, if some component returned an exception because the external system is unreachable, you may be prepared for it with some conditional step that checks that exception and sends an email to the administrator to warn.</p>
