Configuring the catalog
#######################

This section describes the minimal configuration for the catalog. In the administration training are described all the settings in detail.

Click the ``sign in`` to connect as administrator. The default account is username ``admin`` with password ``admin``.

Once connected, the top toolbar should provide a link to the ``Admin console`` and your login details.

Most of the system configuration parameters can be changed by administrator users using the web interface in ``Admin console`` > ``Settings``.

.. important:: Configuration of these parameters is critically important for the catalog in an operational context. Misunderstanding some settings may result in a system that does not function as expected. For example, downloads may fail to be correctly processed, or metadata harvesting from other servers may not work.

Catalog description
-------------------

- **Catalog came** The name of the node. Information that helps identify the
  catalogue to a human user. The name is displayed on the banner, in the CSW
  GetCapabilities.

- **Catalog identifier** A universally unique identifier (uuid) that
  distinguishes your catalog from any other catalog. This a unique
  identifier for your catalogue and its best to leave it as a uuid. It will
  be used by harvester using GeoNetwork protocol to identify the source catalog.

- **Organization** The organization the node belongs to. Again, this is
  information that helps identify the catalogue to a human user.

- **SVN UUID** Subversion repository attached to the node. This identifier is
  created and/or checked on startup to verify that the database match the SVN repository.
  The repository is used for metadata versionning.

Catalog Server
--------------


- **Host** The node's name or IP number (without http://). For example,
  they are used during metadata editing to create resource links and
  when returning the server's capabilities during a CSW request.

 - If your node is publicly accessible from the Internet, you have to use the domain name.

 - If your node is hidden inside your private network and you have a firewall or web server
   that redirects incoming requests to the node, you have to enter the public address of
   the firewall or web server. A typical configuration is to have an Apache web server
   on address A that is publicly accessible and redirects the requests to a Tomcat server
   on a private address B. In this case you have to enter A in the host parameter.


- **Port** The server's port number (usually 80 or 8080). If using HTTP, set it to 80.

- **Preferred Protocol** Defined the protocol to access the catalog. The HTTP protocol
  used to access the server. Choosing http means that all communication with the catalog
  will be visible to anyone listening to the protocol. Since this includes usernames
  and passwords this is not secure. Choosing https means that all communication with the catalog
  will be encrypted and thus much harder for a listener to decode.

- **Secure Port** The secure port number.

- **Log level** Define the logging level of the application. After modification,
  log can be checked in the ``Statistics & status`` section under ``Activity``.

Intranet parameters
-------------------

A common need for an organisation is to automatically discriminate between anonymous
internal users that access the node from within an organisation (Intranet) and
anonymous external users from the Internet. The catalog defines anonymous users
from inside the organisation as belonging to the group *Intranet*, while anonymous
users from outside the organisation are defined by the group *All*. To automatically
distinguish users that belong to the Intranet group you need to tell the catalog
the intranet IP address and netmask.

- **Netmask** The intranet netmask (eg. 255.255.255.0).


- **Network*** The intranet address in IP form (eg. 147.109.100.0).

Proxy server
------------


- **Use proxy** Enable the proxy in case the catalog is behind a proxy and need
  to use it to access remote resources.

- **Proxy Host** The proxy IP address or name

- **Port** The proxy port

- **Proxy username** The username

- **Proxy user password** The username password

- ***Ignore host list** To bypass specific hosts enter a specific IP address or
  host name such as www.mydomain.com or an address range using wildcards,
  such as 192.168.2.*. Use | to separate the different host values.


JVM proxy parameters may also be required to properly set the proxy for all remote
access.


.. _system-config-feedback:

Feedback
--------

Email may be sent by the catalog.

- you are using the User Self-registration system

- you are using the metadata status workflow

- a file uploaded with a metadata record is downloaded and notify privilege is selected


This section configure the mail server to use.

- **Email** This is the administrator's email address used to send feedback.

- **SMTP host** The mail server name or IP address to use for sending emails.

- **SMTP port** The SMTP port.

- **Use SSL** Enable SSL mode

- **User name** Username if connection is required on the SMTP server

- **Password** Username password if connection is required on the SMTP server
