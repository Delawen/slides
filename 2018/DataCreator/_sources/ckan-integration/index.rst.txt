Integrate with CKAN
===================

Sometimes you have two very different groups of users that want to consume your data: one group specialized in spatial data and familiar with OGC standards and another group specialized in open data and familiar with linked data. Some organizations fix this issue by having two different portals with their data synchronized: GeoNetwork and CKAN.

Harvest to GeoNetwork
---------------------

PyCSW can be `added to CKAN as an extension`_ to add a CSW endpoint to CKAN. As GeoNetwork can harvest from any CSW endpoint, we can collect data from CKAN to GeoNetwork easily and keep them syncronized.

Notice that sometimes the conversion from CKAN data formats to CSW may not be complete, so there may be loss of data when harvesting from a CKAN endpoint.

Harvest from GeoNetwork
-----------------------

There is a `ckan-geonetwork harvester`_ available that you can install on your CKAN to get all the data available in GeoNetwork also available on a CKAN portal. This way you can use all the power of the metadata editors in GeoNetwork and while making your ckan users happy.

Also, CKAN can harvest CSW endpoints, which can be used to harvest the CSW endpoint of GeoNetwork.

Making data available as RDF
----------------------------

If you like your GeoNetwork user interface, you don't need to sacrify it in favor of CKAN to have linked data. GeoNetwork allows users to download their data on RDF format.
